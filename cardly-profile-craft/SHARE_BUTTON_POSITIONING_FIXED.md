# 📍 **SHARE BUTTON POSITIONING - FIXED!**

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED: Share Button No Longer Hiding Company Name**

You were absolutely right! The share button was positioned over the company name area, making it impossible to read the business name. I've completely fixed this positioning issue.

---

## 🔧 **WHAT WAS WRONG & WHAT I FIXED**

### **❌ Previous Problem:**
```tsx
// BEFORE: Share button covering company name
className="absolute top-5 right-5 w-10 h-10"
// This positioned the button right over the company name area
```

### **✅ What I Fixed:**

#### **1. Moved Share Button to Top-Left Corner**
```tsx
// AFTER: Share button in safe top-left position
className="absolute top-2 left-2 w-8 h-8"
// Now positioned away from company name and content
```

#### **2. Made Button Smaller and More Subtle**
- **Size reduced** from `w-10 h-10` to `w-8 h-8` (40px → 32px)
- **Icon size reduced** from `size={18}` to `size={14}`
- **Position moved** from `top-5 right-5` to `top-2 left-2`

#### **3. Fixed Badge Positioning Conflict**
```tsx
// BEFORE: Badge at top-4 right-4
// AFTER: Badge at top-2 right-2
// Now badge and share button don't interfere with each other
```

## 🎯 **NEW POSITIONING LAYOUT**
